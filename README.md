# Weather Dashboard

In this homework assignment, I was tasked to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

It uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities and uses `localStorage` to store the city search history.


## Acceptance Criteria

I was tasked to meet the following acceptance criteria:

1. When I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
1. When I view current weather conditions for that city, I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
1. When I view the UV index, I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
1. When I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
1. When I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
1. When I open the weather dashboard, I am presented with the last searched city forecast.
